# my_website
This repository contains my website for data visualization purposes, created as part of the **M126 Data Visualization** module at NKUA. The website includes information about myself, interactive shapes that change form upon clicking, a data visualization image with its description, and credits for the website design. 

Additionally, it contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for animations, effects, and interactivity.
